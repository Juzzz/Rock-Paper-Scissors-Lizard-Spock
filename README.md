#Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

A fun little project to test some new techniques:

* Bit shift enumeration
* IBOutletCollection
* Recursive animation
* Simple computer AI
* Dynamic objects (for extending the app like the Lizard, Spock feature)

##Play
It is very easy to play.
Type in your name and choose an difficulty.
Than choose normal or the extension Lizard Spock:

##Extending
In the Future I want to change/add some things:

* More Dynamic. I think I want to use plists to configure the signs and relations. In this way I can easily add a new rock paper scissors type.
* Core-data for saving score.
* game center? If I want to publish it.

If you have any new idea's, there welcome!
